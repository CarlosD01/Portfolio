                        For as long as I can remember, I've loved to create things for others to enjoy. And while time has passed, the kid who used to spend whole afternoons making stop motion animations, or sit in his room for days obsessively editing a YouTube video is still very much a part of me, and now hopes to make a career of his passions.

                        <br>
                        Though my education and experience are rather unconventional in the field of UI design, they haave shaped my interests and professional aspirations. Whether it was my bachelor's degree in psychology, my time as an undergraduate research assistant, or even my self-education, each experience has cultivated my knowledge and skills, and likewise, interest in technology and design.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Ultimately, it is my goal to work as a UI designer for companies like Epic Games, Insomniac Games, Sony Playstation, and NVIDIA in the hopes that I can help develop the next generation of innovative and immersive games and hardware. From the moment I first played Halo: Combat Evolved on the original Xbox, to the countless rounds of Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 - Zombies I played throughout my teens, I have been hooked on the gaming bug. Video games have given me the ability to experience entertainment and storytelling in a medium that is unlike any other, and my hope is that I too can innovate and push the boundaries to see what is possible with video games.
